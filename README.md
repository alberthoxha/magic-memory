# Magic-memory

This repository contains a memory game that I developed while following a course by NetNinja. Throughout the course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in managing state, utilizing useEffects, and various other concepts. This project provided me with a great learning experience and helped enhance my understanding of these important concepts.
